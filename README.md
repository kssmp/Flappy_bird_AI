# Flappy_bird_AI

This is a version of the popular game 'Flappy Bird' created using the Pygame library. In this implementation, players navigate through obstacles that appear on the screen. The unique aspect of this project is its utilization of AI, which enables up to 30 generations of gameplay, with the game resetting after each one. The program autonomously controls the game using artificial intelligence, eliminating the need for manual user input. Neat-Python was employed to construct and train an AI model, initially starting with only 10 birds. Impressively, the AI model quickly achieved proficiency, mastering the game within just 5 generations.
